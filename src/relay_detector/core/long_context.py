"""Protocol-agnostic needle-in-haystack primitives for long-context detection.

The long-context detector probes whether a relay actually honors the model's
advertised context window, or silently truncates / routes to a smaller-window
model. Each protocol's detector calls into here to:

  1. Build a multi-needle haystack of approximately N tokens
  2. Send it through the relay (protocol-specific)
  3. Score how many needles the model can recall

Why three needles at 10% / 50% / 90%:
  - A single needle at the end is fooled by relays that pass head + tail and
    drop the middle. Three positions catches sliding-window truncation.
  - Multiple needles also smooth out occasional natural recall failures —
    even genuine 1M-context Claude misses ~1% of needles.

We don't use copyrighted text; the haystack is generated from random
template instantiations so it's deterministic-by-seed yet not in any
public dataset (which would let a model cheat via memorization).

# Empirical chars-per-token for our synthetic templated filler — varies

# chars/token sends MORE actual tokens than the tier label promises (we
# overshoot the target — some buffer below means we won't blow past
# ctx_limit). Overestimating sends FEWER (we undershoot — coverage
# silently drops below the tier label).

#   OpenAI 6.0 ← gpt-4o-mini live: 32k→31397 / 100k→99144 (~99% accuracy)

#                    on 200k tier with HTTP 400 "prompt too long")
#   Gemini 5.5 ← unmeasured, conservative middle estimate
# Note Claude's chars/token varies with content length:
#   small (32k):  ~5.22 chars/tok
#   medium (100k): ~5.22 chars/tok
#   large (200k clamped): ~5.93 chars/tok
# Picking 5.5 lands the small/medium tiers slightly above target (no
