"""Protocol-agnostic needle-in-haystack primitives for long-context detection.

The long-context detector probes whether a relay actually honors the model's
advertised context window, or silently truncates / routes to a smaller-window
model. Each protocol's detector calls into here to:

  1. Build a multi-needle haystack of approximately N tokens
  2. Send it through the relay (protocol-specific)
  3. Score how many needles the model can recall

Why three needles at 10% / 50% / 90%:
  - A single needle at the end is fooled by relays that pass head + tail and
    drop the middle. Three positions catches sliding-window truncation.
  - Multiple needles also smooth out occasional natural recall failures —
    even genuine 1M-context Claude misses ~1% of needles.

We don't use copyrighted text; the haystack is generated from random
template instantiations so it's deterministic-by-seed yet not in any
public dataset (which would let a model cheat via memorization).
