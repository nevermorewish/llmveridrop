"""OpenAI long-context truncation detector — needle-in-haystack.

Tests whether the relay actually delivers the model's advertised context
window or silently truncates / routes to a smaller-window model.

Strategy (tiered, stop-on-first-failure):

  Tier 1: 32k tokens   — catches transport-layer truncation (nginx body cap)
  Tier 2: 100k tokens  — catches mid-tier truncation (relay summarizes long inputs)
  Tier 3: 200k tokens  — catches high-end truncation (relay routes 4o → 4o-mini)

Each tier sends a haystack with three needles at 10% / 50% / 90% positions
and asks the model to retrieve them. We stop probing further tiers as
soon as one fails — there's no point spending $0.30 on the 200k probe
when the 32k probe already proved truncation at 16k.

Opt-in (config.include_long_context). Default: skipped.
