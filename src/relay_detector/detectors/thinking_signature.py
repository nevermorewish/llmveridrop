"""ThinkingSignatureDetector — DESIGN.md §3.3 ⭐.

Active. The crown-jewel detector: extended/adaptive thinking emits a
signature_delta event whose payload is a server-side cryptographic signature.
A relay station impersonating Claude with another model literally cannot
forge this signature.

Sub-checks:
  100 — thinking block (or redacted_thinking) exists, signature non-empty
        and long enough to look like a real Anthropic signature
   70 — thinking block exists, signature present but suspiciously short
   30 — thinking block exists but signature_delta never arrived
    0 — thinking parameter ignored / no thinking block at all

applies_to() filters out models that don't support thinking at all.
For models that support both extended and adaptive (Sonnet 4.6), we prefer
extended because budget_tokens gives us tighter cost control.
