"""ConsistencyDetector — DESIGN.md §3.4.

Active. Two layers:
  1. response.model field matches the requested model (bidirectional prefix)
  2. With temperature=0, output_tokens are stable across N runs (CV < 0.1)

Quick mode simplifies to a single call (just the model-field check); the
stability sub-score is recorded as "skipped" and given full credit so the
detector's max stays 100. Standard/Full do the full 3-run stability test.
